### Steps to Create the React Project and Components

1. **First:** Create a folder named `React-Props-Lab` and inside it, create a React project named `React-01-lab`.

2. **Second:** Inside the `src` folder, create a folder named `component`.

3. **Third:** Create a component named `Programers` that contains:
    - Name
    - Programming languages
    - Years of experience
    - Company

    Add three programmers and display their information in the program interface.

4. **Next:** Create 2 components:
    - `Companies`: Contains the company name, number of employees, and year of establishment.
    - `Services`: Contains the types of services and their expected prices.

    Display the company information followed by our employees and the services provided.

5. **Lastly:** If the employee is from Tuwaiq Academy, change the color of their card to purple. If the employee is from any other company, set the color of their card to gray.
